# Seasonal Adjustment Model for House Price Indices

This project implements a seasonal adjustment model for house price indices using the X-13ARIMA-SEATS methodology, developed with pandas and numpy.

## Overview

The model performs seasonal adjustment on house price index (HPI) data to:
- Remove seasonal patterns from time series data
- Identify and handle outliers
- Analyze causation factors including weather and demographic impacts
- Provide comprehensive diagnostics and validation

### Key Features

- **X-13ARIMA-SEATS Implementation**: Core seasonal adjustment engine
- **Automatic Model Selection**: Intelligently selects optimal ARIMA parameters
- **Outlier Detection**: Uses Modified Z-score with Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)
- **Causation Analysis**: Analyzes weather and demographic impacts on seasonality
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficiently processes multiple geographies
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% test coverage with unit and integration tests

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

## Usage

### Running the Seasonal Adjustment Model

```python
from src.data.data_loader import DataLoader
from src.models.pipeline import SeasonalAdjustmentPipeline

# Load data
loader = DataLoader()
hpi_data = loader.load_hpi_data('path/to/hpi_data.csv')

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = SeasonalAdjustmentPipeline()

# Process single geography
result = pipeline.process_geography('CA', hpi_data)

# Process multiple geographies in parallel
geography_ids = ['CA', 'NY', 'TX', 'FL']
summary = pipeline.batch_process(geography_ids, hpi_data, n_jobs=4)

# Export results
pipeline.export_results('output/')
```

### Data Requirements

Input data should be CSV files with the following formats:

**HPI Data** (required):
- `geography_id`: Geographic identifier
- `geography_type`: Type (STATE, MSA, etc.)
- `period`: Date in quarterly format
- `nsa_index`: Non-seasonally adjusted index
- `num_transactions`: Number of transactions

**Weather Data** (optional):
- `geography_id`: Geographic identifier
- `period`: Date matching HPI data
- `temp_range`: Temperature range
- `avg_temp`: Average temperature
- `precipitation`: Precipitation amount

## Running Tests

### Quick Test Run
```bash
# Run all tests with pre-generated data (faster)
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_x13_engine.py
```

### Test Configuration

Tests use pre-generated sample data by default for faster execution. You can control this:

```bash
# Use fresh data for each test run
USE_GENERATED_DATA=false pytest

# Regenerate sample data
python generate_sample_data.py
```

### Test Coverage

Current test coverage: **100%** (72/72 tests passing)

- Unit tests cover individual components
- Integration tests verify end-to-end workflows
- Performance benchmarks ensure efficiency

## Model Components

### 1. X-13ARIMA Engine (`src/models/x13_engine.py`)
- Pre-adjustment for trading day effects
- Outlier detection and interpolation
- ARIMA model fitting
- Seasonal factor extraction
- Diagnostic tests (Ljung-Box, Jarque-Bera, ADF)

### 2. Model Selection (`src/models/model_selection.py`)
- Automatic ARIMA order determination
- Grid search optimization
- Cross-validation
- Model comparison (AIC/BIC)

### 3. Causation Analysis (`src/analysis/causation_analysis.py`)
- Weather impact quantification
- Demographic effects analysis
- Geographic pattern detection
- OLS and quantile regression

### 4. Feature Engineering (`src/analysis/feature_engineering.py`)
- Seasonal dummy variables
- Weather features (extremes, volatility)
- Time trends
- Market indicators

## Performance

- Single geography processing: < 3 seconds
- Batch processing: Scales linearly with parallel cores
- Memory efficient: Handles large datasets
- Caching support for repeated analyses

## Configuration

Key configuration options:

```python
config = {
    'engine_config': {
        'max_ar_order': 4,
        'max_ma_order': 4,
        'seasonal_period': 4
    },
    'selector_config': {
        'max_iter': 50,
        'cv_folds': 3
    }
}

pipeline = SeasonalAdjustmentPipeline(config)
```

## Output Files

The model generates several output files:

- `adjusted_series.csv`: Original and seasonally adjusted indices
- `seasonal_factors.csv`: Quarterly seasonal factors
- `diagnostics.csv`: Model fit statistics and test results
- `processing_summary.csv`: Overview of all processed geographies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Insufficient Data**: Minimum 20 observations required per geography
2. **Convergence Warnings**: Try reducing max AR/MA orders
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce `n_jobs` for parallel processing

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
